# Mining Online Shopper Intention Data

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes online shopper intention data. It explores the dataset, performs preprocessing, and applies data mining techniques to gain insights into shopper behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **`online_shoppers_intention.csv`**, which contains various features related to website visits, including:
- **Administrative, Informational, ProductRelated**: Number of different types of pages visited.
- **BounceRates, ExitRates, PageValues**: Metrics indicating user engagement.
- **Month, OperatingSystems, Browser, Region, TrafficType**: Visitor attributes.
- **VisitorType, Weekend, Revenue**: Behavioral and outcome-related features.

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Understanding the Data**: Loading and exploring the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing patterns and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features if necessary.
5. **Applying Machine Learning Models**: Implementing classification models to predict shopper behavior.
6. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Analyzing model performance and deriving business insights.
